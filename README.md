### CyberSecurity Analyst with a passion for installing firewall and encryption tools, reporting breaches or weak spots on networks and data. Just recently completed a B.S in Supply Chain Management and earned a certification in Data Analytics at the University of Minnesota with the desire to look for new opportunities. I consider myself to be a leader, team player and a student that brings passion and determination to any project.
